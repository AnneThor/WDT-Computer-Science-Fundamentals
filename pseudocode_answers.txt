Short Answer
1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
The point is to determine in advance the logic of the program and split it down into basic steps.  This can help find problems and determine a good solution before you start coding.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
You would get an error message because it's not an actual language that can be understood/compiled by the computer.

Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

FUNCTION compareTwoNumbers
    INPUT numberA
    INPUT numberB
    IF numberA > numberB RETURN A
    ELSE return B
ENDFUNCTION

2.  Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

FUNCTION printNumbers
    SET number to 1
    WHILE number < 101
        PRINT number
        number++
    ENDWHILE
ENDFUNCTION

3.  Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

FUNCTION findEntry
    INPUT numberToFind
    INPUT phonebookEntries
    Call the Array.find() method on the phonebookEntries using numberToFind parameters
ENDFUNCTION


4.  Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

const phonebookEntries = [ {name: "Anne", number: 3334657}, {name: "Sarah", number: 3334887}, {name: "Julie", number: 3322657} ];

function findEntry(numberToFind, phonebookEntries) {
  return phonebookEntries.find( (entry, number) => entry.number === numberToFind);
}

findEntry(3334657, phonebookEntries);
//returns the object { name: 'Anne', number: 3334657 }
